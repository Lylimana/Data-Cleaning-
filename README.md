Welcome! 

This is my first ever SQL Project. 

In this project I will be cleaning and exploring the layoffs data set. 

I have been practicing SQL through Alex The Analysts tutorial 'Learn SQL Beginner to Advanced in Under 4 Hours'. I have been documenting my progress through my SQL practice repository on my Github.

The aim of this project is to apply the lessons I've learnt across my SQL journey into this project and to create a good foundation for future projects to come.
